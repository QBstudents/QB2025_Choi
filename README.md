I'm an PhD student at thge Moczek lab. I'd like to learn how to manage my data using R and R studio, and also want to get used to use Gut and Git hub.
Also, although I'm an EEB student, I don't have much knowledge on biodiversity and ecology (My interest is more like genetics and evolution), so I'd like to learn more about them.
